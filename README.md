# Stewardship of the Open Source Riak .NET Client

Hi, I'm Luke and I'm speaking at .NET Fringe, so I built this on `reveal.js`. You're welcome to fork it.

## Get involved

I'm talking because I believe open source contribution can have a huge impact. I'd love to have your contribution to the main goal of building a great [.NET client for Riak here](https://github.com/basho/riak-dotnet-client). 

If you're curious, **Riak .NET Client** is a .NET library which makes it easy to communicate with [Riak](http://basho.com/riak/), an open source, distributed database that focuses on high availability, horizontal scalability, and *predictable* latency. Both Riak and this code is maintained by [Basho](http://www.basho.com/).
